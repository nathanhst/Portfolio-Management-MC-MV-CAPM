# Portfolio-Management-MC-MV

This little algorithm gives the efficient frontier and optimal allocation for a given set of equities, through averaging between the two methods : Monte Carlo and Mean Variance.
Equities can be selected in "Portfolio.py" and everything can be run from "MonteCarloPortfolioOptimization.py". The risk-free rate for the calculation of the Sharpe Ratio is set to 0 for convenience.
